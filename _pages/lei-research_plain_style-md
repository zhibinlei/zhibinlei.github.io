## Single-sided subduction (SSS): High trench retreat rate & back-arc extension

Models can self-consistently generate a variety of trench retreat rate and induce different extent of extension within a homogeneous and mobile overriding plate. This is achieved by verying merely the age/thickness of the subducting slab and overriding plate under a well-tested rheology setup.

Comparison of horizontal & vertical velocity component for models with increasing trench retreat rate, suggesting that non-uniform basal drag accounts for the rifting and spreading back-arc area.

Contribution of this work relative to previous work.

## Dual inward dipping subduction (DIDS) & progressive weakening within the overriding plate

Relative to SSS, DIDS can generate:  1) fixed boundary condition for the middle overriding plate 2) a stronger united upwelling mantle flow. Both effects
contribute to the progressive weakening, exbited as viscosity reduction, within the overriding plate.
